# meningiomas
R scripts for analysis of NGS meningioma data

README

The following code performs the analysis performed in "Multiple approaches converge on three biological subtypes of meningioma and extract new insights from published studies", Bayley et al. 2021. Additional code (such as that used to generate figures for the study) or data is available at request to james.bayley@bcm.edu.

Raw data for our cohort is available at GEO:
Superseries: GSE189673
DNA methylation: GSE189521
RNA-seq: GSE189672

All .csv files needed to run this code, including the processed methylation and RNA-seq data, are available at:
https://bcm.box.com/s/nsd4pwofiitxvp0zh1sp56way2z8mkti

Code at time of publication is stored at Zenodo, while the github page will be maintained, featuring updated versions with and any necessary updates/corrections.

Finally, I'm just a neurosurgeon and only an amateur programmer, so please don't judge any inefficient code and do let me know if you find any errors. Thanks!
